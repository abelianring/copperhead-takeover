Copperhead as a company doesn't share the goals and vision of this project and
will not be involved in future endeavors. There is an attempt by James
Donaldson to gain control over this project to pursue typical infosec industry
rent seeking but can assure you it won't succeed.

CopperheadOS is a mix of code written before the company was founded, on my own
time and on company time. It isn't possible to continue development due to the
conflict. To be fair, here's their attempt at a coherent story: (A)

Spent almost four years working on this only to have it destroyed by my
completely selfish, narcissistic and untrustworthy business partner. If you
want it to continue, feel free to contact james.donaldson@copperhead.co and
demand that he step down. Sorry for letting you down.
